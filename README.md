## 🧠 Overview

This project combines Artificial Intelligence (AI), Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO), and blockchain technology to optimize the distribution of healthcare donations. It ensures that:
- **Donations go where they’re needed most**, based on AI assessments.
- **Voters and donors remain in control** through DAO governance.
- **All actions are transparent and verifiable** via blockchain.

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🤖 **AI Triage Engine** – Assesses patients by severity, financial urgency, and hospital needs.
- 🗳️ **DAO Voting** – Transparent governance by donors using token-weighted voting.
- 🔐 **Smart Contracts** – Trustless fund distribution and proposal execution.
- 📊 **Transparent Dashboard** – Track where every donation goes in real-time.
- 📥 **Application Portal** – Patients and hospitals apply for help via a simple form.
- 🧾 **Audit-Ready** – Immutable records of every transaction and decision.
